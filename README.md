Analyzing neural connections – why/how they are formed and their behavior in different circumstances – is crucial to develop an understanding of core brain processes. 
We developed an interactive neural plasticity visualization platform tailored towards dynamic synaptic networks, available on an easily accessible web interface. PlastiVisprovides an overview of the data with a 3D visualization alongside a 2D panel to assess change over time for a more detailed analysis of synaptic activity.
